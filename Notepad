[8/14, 10:11 AM] Gunina: Urgent WFH Request: 18â€“29 August
[8/14, 10:48 AM] Gunina: I hope you're doing well.
I wanted to inform you that I haven't taken a single leave since March and have also come to the office on some weekends to elevate my learnings and work.
Now that I need to go home after several months due to reasons, I'd be grateful if you'd grant me work from home from 18 August to 29 August. I'd still be putting in the same efforts and focus that I've been doing up till now.

I have already aligned with my team lead regarding this request, and he has no concerns.

I would truly appreciate your understanding and support in this matter, and I assure you that my productivity will remain unaffected during this period.

Best regards,



I hope you are doing well.

I am currently in the shadow phase for the JLP account. I spoke with my project manager regarding taking work from home from 18 August to 29 August, and he agreed to it but suggested that I should get your approval since I am in the shadow period.

I have not taken a single leave since March and have also come to the office on some weekends to dedicate more time to my learning. I will continue to maintain the same level of focus and effort during this period, ensuring that my productivity remains unaffected.
