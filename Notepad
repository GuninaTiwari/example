[8/14, 10:11 AM] Gunina: Urgent WFH Request: 18â€“29 August
[8/14, 10:48 AM] Gunina: I hope you're doing well.
I wanted to inform you that I haven't taken a single leave since March and have also come to the office on some weekends to elevate my learnings and work.
Now that I need to go home after several months due to reasons, I'd be grateful if you'd grant me work from home from 18 August to 29 August. I'd still be putting in the same efforts and focus that I've been doing up till now.

I have already aligned with my team lead regarding this request, and he has no concerns.

I would truly appreciate your understanding and support in this matter, and I assure you that my productivity will remain unaffected during this period.

Best regards,
